# IncrementalGame

## Description
Game clicker (Incremental game) adalah Game inkremental, juga dikenal sebagai game clicker, game mengklik, atau game ketuk, adalah game video yang gameplaynya terdiri dari pemain yang melakukan tindakan sederhana seperti mengklik layar berulang kali. 

Incremental games, also known as clicker games, clicking games (on PCs) or tap games (in mobile games), are video games whose gameplay consists of the player performing simple actions such as clicking on the screen repeatedly. This "grinding" earns the player in-game currency which can be used to increase the rate of currency acquisition.[1] In some games, even the clicking becomes unnecessary at some point, as the game plays itself, including in the player's absence,[2] hence the moniker idle game.
